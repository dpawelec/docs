# System architecture

The B2B-Suite is a collection of loosely coupled mostly uniform **components** packaged with a small example plugin and a common library.

## Component layering

A single component with all layers and the maximum of allowed dependencies looks like this:

The responsibilities from bottom to top:

| Layer       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| Frontend    | Controller as a service for frontend access                                                                                                                                                                      |
| B2B-Plugin  | Store front access to the services                                                                                                                                                                               |

## Component dependencies

At the time of this writing there are 18 different components, all build with the same structure. We sorted these components into four different complexes:

#### Common - The one Exception

There is a small library of shared functionality. It contains a few commonly used **technical** implementations that are shared between most components like exception classes, repository helpers, a dependency manager, or a REST-API router.

#### User-Management

The user management is based on the `StoreFrontAuthentication` component and then provides `Contact` and `Debtor` entities which have `Address`es and `Role`s. These entities are mostly informational and CRUD based. Other parts of the system only depend on the `StoreFrontAuthentication` component but not the specific implementations as debtor or contact.

#### ACL

The `Acl` implementation is connected to most other entities provided by the B2B-Suite.

#### Order and Contingent Management

`ContingentGroups`s are connected to `Debtor`s and can have `Acl` settings based on `Role`s or `Contact`s. `Order`s are personalized through the `StoreFrontAuthentication`.

#### The whole picture

Most dependencies are directly derived from requirements. So, the dependency flow of the components should follow the basic business needs. There are a few exception, mainly the M:N assignment components each representing a reset in complexity where a complex feature just resolves itself into a context object for another use case. You can think of it like that.

* A Debtor has can be created and updated through a service **=>** _The debtor is an **entity**_
* A Debtor may be an entity connected to many workflows by it's id **=>** _The Debtor is just the **context**_

So - for the sake of completeness - this is the whole picture:

Everything you should get from that is, that there is a left to right propagation of dependencies. The components on the left side can be used and even useful entirely without the components on the right side.
